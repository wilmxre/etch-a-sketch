make a game, where one person draws something in like a 5 by 5 canvas and the
other person has to guess that drawing.
the drawer has to use 10 squares.
the squares of the drawing have to connect with each other (by side not corners)
the guesser has 5 guesses.
if the guesser has guessed a correct square it becomes green, if it was right next to it, then yellow, if not then red.
